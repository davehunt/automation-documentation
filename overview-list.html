<p>Below you will find a list of the various automated testing frameworks in use at Mozilla, along with a brief description and a link to read more.
Generally, you should pick the lowest-level framework that you can. If you are testing JavaScript but don't need a window, use XPCShell. If you're
testing page layout, try to use reftest. The advantage is that you don't drag in a lot of other components that might have their own problems, so
you can hone in quickly on any bugs in what you are specifically testing.</p>
